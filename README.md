# Lausch

Lausch is a Rust tool that allows a user to dictate text via voice for input into any text field using simulated keypress events.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --git https://git.svc.vesey.tech/will/lausch
```

## Usage

If key inputs are not being sent, you may need to refer to [inputbot](https://github.com/obv-mikhail/InputBot)) documentation for additional permissions configuration.

```bash
lausch
```
